Here is a list of publications somehow related to our problem.

## Animal illness prediction

1. [Similarity networks for classification: a case study in the Horse Colic problem from Lluís Belanche and Jerónimo Hernández][colic_nn]
2. [Predicting Lameness in Sheep Activity Using Tri-Axial Acceleration Signals][sheep]

## Activity detection

1. [Validity and practical utility of accelerometry for the measurement of in-hand physical activity in horses][accel_horse]
2. [Development of Equine Gait Recognition Algorithm][equine_gate]
3. [A Comparison of Feature Extraction Methods for the Classification of Dynamic Activities From Accelerometer Data][feature]  
   

## Ballistocardiography

1.[SHORT-TERM HEART RATE VARIABILITY AS A GENERAL INDICATOR OF HEALTH ESTIMATED BY BALLISTOCARDIOGRAPHY USING A HYDRAULIC BED SENSOR IN ELDER][bedsensor]  
2.[Physiological Parameter Estimation Using a Head-mounted Wearable Device][google]  - this article has a good description of algoritm of pulse and breath rate extraction from accelerometer data. It was used as a base for horse heart rate estimation research



## Patern recognition
1. [A new neural network approach for seismic event detection][deepdetect] - should check of applicability to unusual activity detection during colic (paid article from IEEE)

## Patents
 1. Mobile animal surveillance and distress monitoring [NightWatch24 US Patent N9629340][patent_nw]
 2. [Supervision System of Evolution of a horse][patent_fr]
