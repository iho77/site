First of all - we need more data to do something usefull. Here I ll try to list all available datasets according to horses.
Generally thats all I found up to this moment. If you know something else - please send me link.

1. An old (1989) dataset from ics.uci.edu with colic sympthoms. [Horse colic dataset][Horse-colic]
   Here we can find 368 records with 28  attributes like Age, Temperature, Respiratory rate etc.
2. My real data from accelerometer and gyroscope located on halter. [Horse walking dataset][steps]
3. NEW!! My real data from accelerometer located on halter. 7 hours(!!!) of data sampled at 32 Hz from live horse walking on paddock. He ate, slept, walking and asked for dinner. [Horse paddock dataset][steps]
