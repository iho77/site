First of all - we need more data to do something usefull. Here I ll try to list all available datasets according to horses.
Generally thats all I found up to this moment. If you know something else - please send me link.

1. An old (1989) dataset from ics.uci.edu with colic sympthoms. [Horse colic dataset][Horse-colic]
   Here we can find 368 records with 28  attributes like Age, Temperature, Respiratory rate etc.
