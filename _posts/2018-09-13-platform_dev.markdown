Working on the platform to acquire data from the horse, I thought, that such kind of data acquisition platform can have value by itself. In all the papers I read about pattern recognition every research use some kind of custom build set of sensors. But it is rather simple to make universal data acquisition platform based on this project. We can easily acquire accelerometer data, calculate all known features and store it somewhere in the cloud. To think wider, we can easily imagine some kind of marketplace where AI\ML researches can suggest solutions for data owners, based on stored data...
Good idea for a start-up or pivot? Maybe, but I do not see the market for this clearly...
